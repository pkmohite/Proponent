Subject: Quick Question from My Manager

Hi Alice,

I hope you're having a productive week so far. I had a quick question come up from my manager, Paul, after I briefed him on the Monday.com recruitment demo we had earlier.

One of his main concerns was around ensuring strict compliance and legal requirements are met throughout our hiring processes, particularly when it comes to things like EEO data, background checks, employment verification, etc. He wanted to know if the Monday.com platform has any specific modules or functionality to support those types of regulatory needs during recruitment?

Let me know if you have any information around that, or if it's something we could cover in more depth during the follow-up meeting with my recruitment lead Amy next week. I want to make sure I can give Paul a thorough answer.

Thanks in advance!

Jason

Subject: Re: Quick Question from My Manager

Hi Jason,

Thanks for reaching out, and that's an excellent question from your manager Paul. Compliance and legal requirements are absolutely critical, especially in the HR/hiring realm.

The short answer is yes, Monday.com does have robust capabilities built into our recruitment solution to help ensure companies remain fully compliant throughout the hiring process. A few of the key areas include:

EEO Data Collection: We can help automate the confidential collection, tracking, and reporting of EEO data from applicants to meet OFCCP/EEOC requirements.
Background Check Integrations: Our platform integrates with leading background screening vendors to seamlessly order and track background checks during the hiring process.
E-Signature & Form Compliance: Digital signatures, electronic storage of forms like I-9s, and audit trails help maintain full compliance with regulations around record-keeping and onboarding documentation.
Role-Based Permissions: Granular access controls and privacy settings allow you to restrict sensitive applicant/employee data to only authorized individuals.
We have an entire compliance center and partnership ecosystem focused on this area, so I'd be happy to go into much more detail during next week's call. We can also potentially loop in someone from our compliance team if needed.

Let me know if you need any other information in the meantime! Looking forward to connecting again soon.

Best,
Alice

Subject: Re: Quick Question from My Manager

Thanks so much for the thorough response, Alice. I really appreciate you quickly addressing Paul's concerns around compliance - that will help ease his mind.

Having those core compliance capabilities around EEO, background checks, signatures, and data privacy is definitely a critical requirement for us. I'm glad to hear Monday.com has robust functionality and a dedicated focus in this area that we could leverage.

Let's plan to overview this in more depth when we reconnect with Amy and your recruiting expert next week. I'll make sure to include Paul's questions in that discussion as well.

Thanks again!

""Alice: Hi Jason, it's Alice from Monday.com again. I hope you've had a productive week! I wanted to check in and see if you've had a chance to discuss the Monday.com platform further with your team after our demo last week.

Jason: Hi Alice, yes it's been a busy week but we did find time to regroup on Monday.com. Overall the feedback from Sarah, Raj, and others was extremely positive. The capabilities you showcased seem like a great potential fit for streamlining our processes.

Alice: That's great to hear Jason. I'm glad the team saw the value in what we highlighted. Did any other major needs or priorities surface during your internal discussions?

Jason: A couple of things did come up that we'll need to dig deeper on. For one, we have a lot of document collaboration happening across HR initiatives like employee handbooks, policies, job descriptions and more. Being able to streamline that documentation cycle would be valuable.

Alice: Absolutely, I can definitely go over our document management capabilities in more depth. With Monday Workdocs, your team can create, edit, collaborate on, and version control documents all natively inside the platform. No more scrambling through email threads and dealing with conflicting versions.

Jason: That integration would be great to see. Keeping all our documentation centralized with the related project info could eliminate a lot of headaches.

Alice: For sure. What about the other areas of concern that came up in your team discussions?

Jason: Well, we spend a significant portion of our time working closely with hiring managers across departments to recruit for open roles. Having a seamless recruitment workflow that feeds into our broader HR processes would be critical for us. I'm not sure if Monday.com has any functionality specific to that area?

Alice: You're in luck - one of Monday.com's most robust solution areas is recruitment and applicant tracking. We actually have a full hiring & onboarding suite with features like job posting across multiple channels, applicant pipeline management, interview scheduling, offer letter generation, employee onboarding and more.

Jason: Oh wow, I had no idea the capabilities extended that far into the recruitment cycle! That could potentially solve a lot of the clunky handoffs and scattered processes we deal with today. It would be great to get a focused look at those hiring features.

Alice: Absolutely, I'd be happy to set up a deep dive on our recruitment and onboarding solutions specifically for your team. It's definitely an area where we have a lot of purpose-built functionality that could standardize and streamline your processes enormously.

Jason: That would be ideal. Maybe we could have some initial call or screenshare to see the hiring features, then bring in our recruitment leads for a more thorough demo after that?

Alice: Sounds like a plan. Why don't we first schedule a brief 30 minute intro call for me to give you a high-level overview? Then we can identify the best stakeholders to include for a follow-up recruitment demo if it looks promising. How does next Wednesday at 11am CT work for that initial kickoff?

Jason: Next Wednesday 11am CT should work well for me. Let's go ahead and get that on the books.

Alice: Will do, I'll send over a calendar invite with video conferencing details shortly. Looking forward to showcasing how we can take your hiring and recruitment processes to the next level!

Jason: Likewise, I appreciate you quickly addressing that need. Let's plan to continue this conversation on Wednesday.

Alice: Sounds good, talk to you then!""

<!-- Jason/ Alice 2nd Video Meeting Transcript - 2024-02-10 10:20:00 -->

""Alice: Hi Jason, it's Alice from Monday.com again. Thanks for taking the time for another call today.

Jason: No problem at all, Alice. I'm looking forward to seeing what you have to show regarding your document management and recruitment capabilities.

Alice: Definitely. Let me start by sharing my screen and pulling up the Monday Workdocs overview... 

As you can see, your team would be able to draft up all those important HR docs like policies, handbooks, job descriptions, etc. directly in Workdocs. You can @mention teammates to collaborate in real-time, leave comments, and track version history.

Jason: I really like how the documents exist natively alongside all the related project information and workflows. Historically we've had people working in Word, uploading to shared drives, attaching to emails - it gets messy. This embedded document solution could streamline things nicely.

Alice: For sure, no more juggling attachments and files across disparate locations. With Workdocs, your documentation lives centralized right where you need it.

What did you think about the editing experience itself? Being able to co-author documents simultaneously is a huge time saver.

Jason: The real-time collaborative editing functionality seemed really intuitive and powerful, similar to Google Docs. Although I could also see our HRIS manager appreciating the version control and review capabilities when prepping final versions.

Alice: Absolutely, those approval workflows and versioning are critical for important docs like employee handbooks that need tighter controls. We can definitely tailor the permissioning to strike that balance.

Jason: This is looking really promising for our document needs. What about on the recruiting side - can you show how that hiring process would work on the Monday.com platform?

Alice: You bet, let me pull up one of our recruiting solution templates... [she navigates to a sample hiring board]

As you can see, this staffing plan board gives a high-level view across all roles you're hiring for. But we can drill into the pipeline for any individual job.

For example, here's the pipeline for that """"Digital Marketing Specialist"""" role you were hiring for recently...

On this pipeline board, you can see every applicant's status as they move through stages like the initial screening, interviewing, offers, etc. We can also view info like their resume, social profiles, feedback from interviews, and more all in one place.

You'd be able to collaborate with hiring managers directly on this board, adding updates and comments on specific candidates. Then once someone is hired, we can trigger the onboarding process by easily creating their employee record, sharing documentation, and even kicking off equipment and access provisioning.

Jason: Wow this is really slick. I love how you can seamlessly progress people through the different stages of that hiring funnel and share updates in one centralized place. That visibility would be huge for us.

Our recruitment team is currently juggling spreadsheets, documents, emails, tracking apps - consolidating all that into one unified workflow would be a massive improvement. Not to mention that seamless handoff into onboarding and provisioning after we make a hire.

Alice: Definitely, having everything under one roof helps eliminate all those disparate tools and cumbersome processes. We find that alone can save teams dozens of hours per hire when you factor in increased efficiency.

I'm glad the recruitment solution is resonating so far. Did you have any other specific needs or potential use cases you wanted me to walk through?

Jason: This is extremely helpful context, but I do think it would be valuable to loop in our recruitment manager, Amy Wong, for a more in-depth discussion. She'd be able to dig into the nuances of how we could leverage all these capabilities.

Alice: That makes total sense. Why don't we go ahead and schedule a follow-up meeting with Amy included? I can have one of our recruiting experts join as well to do a mock end-to-end scenario tailored for Norman-Day's hiring workflows.

Jason: Sounds like a plan. Let me check Amy's calendar availability... How about next Tuesday at 2pm CT? That would give me a few days to brief her as well.

Alice: Perfect, next Tuesday 2pm CT works on my end. I'll get that meeting on the books and coordinate internally.

Jason: Excellent, thank you again Alice. I know I'm just scratching the surface, but I'm seriously impressed with Monday.com's breadth of functionality so far. I'm confident we're on the right track to finally get our messy processes streamlined and centralized.

Alice: That's great to hear, Jason. I really appreciate you taking the time to thoroughly vet our solution. Looking forward to next week's discussion!""","Norman-Day has been exploring Monday.com to streamline their HR and recruitment processes.

Subject: Request for Pricing & Feature Details

Hi John,

Thanks for the informative demo of Monday.com last week. Our team was impressed with the platform's capabilities, particularly the ability to connect boards and mirror columns to keep information synchronized across related projects. 

As discussed, we're currently evaluating solutions to streamline our marketing campaign management and content production workflows. The content calendar template and marketing campaign management features in Monday.com seem like a great fit.

To move forward with our evaluation, could you please provide more details on your pricing structure for a team of our size (approx. 25 users)? Additionally, it would be helpful to get some documentation or case studies showcasing how other marketing teams have leveraged Monday.com to improve their processes.

We're also curious about the level of customization available within the platform. Can we tailor the templates and automations to match our specific use cases and naming conventions?

Looking forward to your response and continuing the conversation.

Best regards,
Sarah

To: Sarah Johnson
Subject: Re: Request for Pricing & Feature Details

Hi Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in Monday.com. I'm delighted to hear that your team found value in the demo and that our marketing solutions align with your needs.

Regarding pricing, we offer flexible plans based on the number of users and the features required. For a team of 25 users, our Standard plan would cost $750 per month, billed annually. This plan includes access to all the essential features, such as the content calendar, campaign management, automations, and integrations.  

I've attached a few case studies showcasing how other marketing teams have successfully implemented Monday.com to streamline their workflows and drive better results. These should provide some valuable insights into the platform's potential impact.

As for customization, Monday.com is highly adaptable to your unique use cases. You can easily customize templates, create your own automations, and tailor the platform to match your team's naming conventions and branding. Our professional services team is also available to assist with more complex customizations if needed.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like to schedule a follow-up call to discuss the next steps. I'm confident that Monday.com can help your team achieve its marketing goals more efficiently.

Best,
John","<!-- Sarah / Michael / John 1st Video Meeting Transcript - 2024-04-12 15:00:00 -->

John: Hi Sarah, Michael, thanks for making the time for another call today. I wanted to continue our discussion around how Monday.com can support BlueSky Media's marketing workflows.

Sarah: Thanks for preparing that follow-up info, John. Michael and I had a chance to review the case studies and pricing you sent over.

John: Excellent, I'm glad you found that information helpful. What were your overall impressions after looking through those materials?

Michael: I was really impressed with the depth of marketing functionality Monday.com offers. The content calendar, campaign tracking, and social media integration features in particular seem incredibly valuable for streamlining our operations.

Sarah: I agree, Michael. I could see our content creators and social teams being much more efficient with those centralized collaboration tools at their disposal.

John: That's great to hear. One of our key value propositions is eliminating the disparate apps and manual processes that often slow marketing teams down. Everything from planning and execution to performance analysis happens seamlessly in one platform.

Sarah: The customization capabilities also caught my eye. Can you expand on how we could tailor the templates and workflows to match our team's unique processes and terminology?

John: Absolutely. With our no-code customization tools, you can easily modify any of our pre-built templates to include your own custom fields, views, and automations without needing technical resources.

For example, let's say you have specific campaign stages or content types you want to track. You can simply add new columns to the relevant boards and mirror those across any connected projects.

We also have a robust API that makes it easy to push and pull data from Monday.com to integrate with your other business systems. And if you need advanced features like single sign-on or white labeling, we offer professional services engagements to help with those implementations.

Michael: That's really impressive flexibility. One of my main concerns was having to conform to a rigid, pre-defined structure that doesn't match our processes.

John: I can assure you that won't be the case, Michael. Our goal is to empower your team by providing a truly adaptable platform that molds to your needs rather than the other way around.

Sarah: I have to say, I'm feeling more and more confident that Monday.com could be a game-changer for BlueSky's marketing operations. Obviously we'd need to run some final numbers, but are you able to share some potential implementation timelines if we decide to move forward?

John: Of course. Based on a team of your size, we could likely have you fully onboarded and trained within 4-6 weeks from the time of purchase. We'd start by holding a kickoff to define your key requirements and use cases...

Hi Alex,

Thanks for checking in. Our team has been actively testing out Monday.com over the past few weeks, and overall, we're quite impressed with the platform's capabilities.

The workflow automations have been a game-changer for us. We were able to set up automations to handle task assignments, notifications, and status updates, which has already saved us a considerable amount of time and reduced the risk of manual errors. 

We also explored the integrations with our CRM and time tracking tools, and we were pleased to find that the setup process was relatively straightforward. Having all our project data synced across systems has given us a more holistic view of our work and has made reporting much easier.

One area where we did have some questions was around the board permissions and guest access. We often collaborate with external clients and vendors, so we want to ensure that we can maintain control over sensitive information while still fostering seamless communication. Could you provide some more details on how we can set up granular permissions and manage guest access?

Apart from that, I think we have a good understanding of the platform's capabilities and how it can support our IT project management needs. We'd like to move forward with implementing Monday.com for our team.

Could you send over a formal proposal with pricing details and an outline of the onboarding and training process? I'd like to review it with my manager and get the necessary approvals.
